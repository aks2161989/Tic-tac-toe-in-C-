Computer Playing Strategy:
In decreasing priority - 

1. Enter a character to complete a line in a single step
2. Prevent player from completing a line in immediate next step
3. Start a 	GUARANTEED winning strategy
	If computer starts first, mark the central square
	If the player subsequently marks non-corner square, then mark a square that forms an 'L' with the player's square
	If player marks another square to complete a horizontal/vertical line, mark the	last square of the line
	Now the player will mark some square, but if above steps work, then you can complete a line in a single step and win
